    <p id="genesis">"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
        And God said, 'Let there be light,'' and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. God called the light 'day,'' and the darkness he called 'night.'' And there was evening, and there was morning â€”the first day."

        "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."
